    <p>Cardano is a Third Generation blockchain platform that aims to provide a flexible, sustainable, and scalable platform for running smart contracts. Tackling the scalability, interoperability, and sustainability problems of previous generations of blockchains, this will allow it to host a wide range of decentralized finance applications, metaverse projects, decentralized identity solutions and more.</p>

    <p>With the goal of being environmentally sustainable, Cardano uses a non-custodial proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that will have up to four million times the energy efficiency of Bitcoin. In Cardano, stake pool operators run nodes that are responsible for processing transactions on the network and producing blocks. In exchange for this work of adding new data to the blockchain, stake pool operators are rewarded in the form of Cardano's native token, ADA.</p>
        
    <p>A stake pool’s chance of being selected increases the more ADA it has staked to it, so stake pools have a financial incentive to reliably process data 24/7, and in doing so, attract more delegators to their pools. For those who do not want to or cannot run their own stake pool, they can still help secure the network by delegating to an existing pool. These delegators in return receive a share of the pool's rewards proportional to the amount of ADA they stake. Staking rewards are paid out at the end of each epoch, which last five days. Cardano’s staking mechanism is non-custodial, so delegators can re-stake or un-stake their ADA at any time for only the cost of a small transaction fee.</p>
