    <p>If a project on the Cardano network is in need of funding, one method they can use is an Initial Stake Pool Offering, or ISPO. A project will create one or more stake pools and attract delegators to them, with those delegators receiving the project’s token in return. ISPO pools can range from giving you both the normal ADA epoch staking rewards and their token all the way to taking all your staking rewards in exchange for a larger amount of their token. Additionally, many projects will have rewards bonuses in the form of NFTs or extra tokens the longer a delegator stakes to their pools. Thanks to Cardano’s non-custodial staking mechanism, delegators can delegate to ISPOs at no risk to their initial ADA and withdraw at any time, making for a very safe and flexible way for network users to support projects they are interested in and be rewarded in return.</p>
